              üé® Proud to have contributed to my college‚Äôs cultural event,
              Swaran 2K24, as the poster designer! I had the opportunity to
              design the event logo using Photoshop and Cinema 4D, bringing our
              vision to life with a unique and creative touch. It was an amazing
              experience to combine creativity and technical skills to represent
              such a vibrant event. Looking forward to more opportunities to
              design and create!

            üé® I had the pleasure of editing the logo for our Computer Science Engineering department's "Renaissance" event. This project was a fantastic opportunity to refine the visual identity and ensure the logo effectively represented the event. It was rewarding to see the final design come together and contribute to such a significant department event. Looking forward to applying these skills to more creative projects in the future!
